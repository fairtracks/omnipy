    - Beautiful, vibrant and easily distinguishable accent colors.
    - Great readability and better compatibility with Web Content

    The Omnipy adaptations features slightly less contrast for comment
    colors, which is offset by the use of italics to make them stand out.
    These color styles work well with transparent backgrounds to blend in

    align with the Omnipy Selenized styles. """)
